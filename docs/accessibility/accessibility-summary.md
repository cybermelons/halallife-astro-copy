# HalalLife Accessibility Audit Summary

## Current State: NOT WCAG Compliant ❌

The site claims to be "designed with screen reader compatibility in mind" but fails basic accessibility requirements.

### Critical Issues for Blind Users 🚨

1. **No Skip Links**
   - Blind users forced to hear entire navigation on every page
   - Must tab through 15+ links to reach main content

2. **Broken Keyboard Navigation**
   - Dropdown menus only work with mouse hover
   - Restaurant/Cuisine menus inaccessible via keyboard

3. **Missing Form Labels**
   - Newsletter signup has no label
   - Search inputs lack proper associations
   - Contact form needs better error handling

4. **Poor Content Structure**
   - Heading hierarchy broken (h1 → h4)
   - No ARIA landmarks for navigation
   - Missing page regions

5. **Inadequate Link Text**
   - Social media: "F", "T", "I" (meaningless to screen readers)
   - Multiple "Read more" links without context
   - No indication when links open new windows

### By the Numbers

```
Total Issues Found: 32
- Critical: 8 (25%)
- High: 12 (37.5%)
- Medium: 7 (22%)
- Low: 5 (15.5%)

Accessibility Score: 3/10
```

### Most Impacted Users
1. **Blind users** - Cannot navigate efficiently
2. **Keyboard-only users** - Cannot access dropdowns
3. **Screen reader users** - Missing context and labels
4. **Motor impaired users** - Small touch targets

### Quick Wins (Can implement today)
1. Add skip links
2. Fix heading hierarchy
3. Add aria-labels to forms
4. Make dropdowns keyboard accessible
5. Hide decorative SVGs from screen readers

### The Irony 😬
The About page proudly states:
> "Our website is designed with screen reader compatibility in mind—making it easy for blind users to search, explore, and access restaurant info independently."

**Reality:** A blind user would struggle to navigate past the header.

### Estimated Time to Fix
- **Phase 1 (Critical):** 1 week
- **Phase 2 (High):** 2 weeks  
- **Phase 3 (Medium/Low):** 3 weeks
- **Total:** 6 weeks for full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

### Next Steps
1. Implement skip links immediately
2. Fix keyboard navigation for dropdowns
3. Add proper form labels
4. Test with real screen readers (NVDA/JAWS)
5. Get feedback from actual blind users

**Bottom Line:** The site needs significant accessibility work to meet its stated commitment to blind and disabled users.
