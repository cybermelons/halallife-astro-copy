## How do we verify Halal Restaurants?
We verify halal restaurants through these 3 methods.

### Official Certification Check
We start by verifying if the restaurant holds a valid halal certification from globally recognized authorities such as:
- Islamic Food and Nutrition Council of America (IFANCA)
- American Halal Foundation (AHF)
- Halal Transactions of Omaha (HTO)
- Islamic Services of America (ISA)
- Halal Food Council USA (HFCUSA)

We use official digital tools, QR-code scans, and direct communication with certification bodies to validate authenticity.

### Ownership Verification
Next, we confirm whether the restaurant is owned or co-owned by Muslims, emphasizing the owners' commitment to halal compliance throughout their business operations.

### Ingredient and Supply Chain Evaluation
We thoroughly assess the sourcing of ingredients, ensuring all meat and poultry products are exclusively procured from halal-certified suppliers. Additionally, we verify that strict protocols are implemented to avoid cross-contamination.

### On-Site Inspection (In Progress)
Our verification includes on-site inspections of restaurant facilities, kitchens, storage areas, and preparation methods. We confirm adherence to halal standards in cooking processes, equipment usage, and cleanliness.

### Community Feedback Analysis
Finally, we review real customer feedback and endorsements from local Islamic communities, reinforcing that the restaurant consistently serves genuine halal cuisine and maintains consumer trust.

## Our Commitment to Accessibility

### Blind and Screen-Reader-Friendly
Our website is designed with screen reader compatibility in mind—making it easy for blind users to search, explore, and access restaurant info independently.

### Deaf-Friendly Features (Text-First Content)
All key content is presented in clear, written formats. No videos without captions, no voice-only elements—just straightforward, accessible information.

### Wheelchair Accessibility Info
We highlight restaurants with ramps, step-free entry, accessible restrooms, and seating so users with mobility needs can dine out with confidence.

### Filter Features to Match Needs
Easily find restaurants that meet your accessibility requirements using filters for blind-, deaf-, or wheelchair-friendly options—because everyone's experience matters.
